Using Deep Neural Networks for recognizing speech of people with speech impairment (i.e people with Cerebral Palsy, Parkinsons or ALS disease)

The model is an implementation of deep speech2 , the model is forked from [Sean Naren][https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.torch.git]
which was trained on AN4 dataset.

## Features
* Trained on LibriSpeech 100hrs data.
* Modified for Phoneme Recognition.
* Model trained on torgo clean speech dataset gives PER of 8%
